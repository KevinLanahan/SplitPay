SplitPay logic Pseudocode

 1. Create a dicitonary called totals -> to track how much each person owes
 2. Loop through ecah purchase in the purchases list:
       a. Note who paid (purchase["paid_by"])
       b. Loop through each item in purchase["items"]:
               i. Get item price and owner(s)
               ii. Split the price equally among all owners
               iii. For each owner:
                   -Add their share to totals[owner]

       c. After processing all items in teh purchase:
               i. Add the full amount of the purchase to totals[paid_by]
               (as a negative number since they already paid)
 3. After all purchases are processed:
       a. Anyone with a positive total owes money
       b. Anyone with a negative total is owed money

 4. Show the results:
    - Print each person’s name and their balance
    - Positive = they owe
    - Negative = they are owed





Calculating totals for each person
#1. Start with total for each person = 0
#2. Loop through each item:
#   - If item belongs to one person → add full price to their total
#   - If item is split → divide price by number of people and add share to each
#3. Figure out who paid (in this case: Kevin = $100)
#4. For each person:
#   - Amount they owe = their total - amount they paid
#5. If amount is negative → they are owed money
#   If amount is positive → they owe that amount
